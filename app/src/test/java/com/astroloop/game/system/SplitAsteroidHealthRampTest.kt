/**
 * Fragments carry the Endless-mode health ramp too.
 *
 * They did not. `scaleHealth` was called in exactly one place — `spawnAsteroid` — so a LARGE rock
 * at 25 minutes had 675 health while the two MEDIUMs it broke into had 25 each, the untouched base
 * value. Since a maxed build spends most of its time shooting fragments, the ramp was doing a
 * fraction of the work its constant implies, which is a poor thing to be tuning against.
 *
 * The factor is taken from the clock rather than inherited from the parent, so it is the same rule
 * `spawnAsteroid` uses: every asteroid on the field at minute T is worth minute T. Inheriting would
 * let a rock that survived a long time seed weak fragments into a late game specifically designed
 * to stop being survivable.
